    <h2>What is Your Concept of Success?</h2>
    <p>Before we dive in, take a moment to reflect: What does success mean to you? How do you measure it in your own
        life? Feel free to share your thoughts.</p>
    <p>Now, let’s explore how Steven Bartlett and Matthew Syed define success:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Steven Bartlett:</strong> defined his "professional" success as being based around these aspects,
            taking on a <b>
                <m>CHALLENGE</m>
            </b> that is not only <b>
                <m>WORTH WHILE</m>
            </b> doing but is also being approached with a team of <m><b>PEOPLE WHO HE LOVES</b></m>.</li>
        <li><strong>Matthew Syed:</strong> stated the fact that money does not always equal happiness and that he
            himself finds more sense of accomplishment when after pouring his <m><b>HEART & SOUL</b></m> into a project
            and getting it finished he receives <m><b>FEEDBACK</b></m> from <m><b>PEOPLE</b></m> whom <m><b>BENEFIT</b>
            </m> or <m><b>GAIN</b></m> in some way from his work.</li>
        <li><strong>My Perspective:</strong> For me, success as a species should be about living in harmony with our
            planet. It’s about fostering intellectual growth, building sustainable communities,
        <li><strong>My Perspective</strong> for me, success as a species should be about living in harmony with our
            planet. It’s about fostering intellectual growth, building sustainable communities, and preserving
            ecosystems for future generations. True success is not just about individual achievements but about
            collective progress that respects and nurtures the environment.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Also note worthy</h3>
    <p><strong>Steven Bartlet</strong> also emphasizes the importance of personal growth, meaningful relationships, and
        creating a positive impact on the world</p>
    <p><strong>Matthew Syed</strong> went on to highlight the value of continuous learning, resilience, and embracing
        failure as a stepping stone to success.</p>

    <h2>What is a Growth Mindset?</h2>
    <p>A growth mindset is the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication and hard work.
        It’s about embracing challenges, learning from criticism, and persisting in the face of setbacks.</p>
    <h3>Tips to Build and Maintain a Growth Mindset:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>View challenges as opportunities to grow.</li>
        <li>Replace “I can’t” with “I can’t yet.”</li>
        <li>Celebrate small wins and progress.</li>
        <li>Learn from feedback and constructive criticism.</li>
        <li>Surround yourself with people who inspire and challenge you.</li>
        <li>Remember that no matter the room or how many people are in it no one person has all the answers so never be
            afraid to speak your truth.</li>
    </ul>
