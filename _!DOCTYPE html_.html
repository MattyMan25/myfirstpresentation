    <h1><m>World Leading Mindset Expert: How to Reach Your Full Potential</m></h1>
    <h2>From <u><b>"THE DIARY OF A CEO"</b>
        </u> series</h2>



    <h2><m><u>What is Your Concept of Success?</u></m></h2>
    <p>Before we dive in, take a moment to reflect: What does success mean to you? How do you measure it in your own
        life? Feel free to share your thoughts.</p>
    <p>Now, let’s explore how Steven Bartlett and Matthew Syed define success:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Steven Bartlett:</strong> defined his "professional" success as being based around these aspects,
            taking on a <mark>challenge</mark> that is <mark>worth while</mark>
            </b> doing but also approaching those with a team of <mark>people he loves</mark>. These things help keep him motivated which helps him to achieve more and he benefits from the healthy human connections in his workplace</li>
        <li><strong>Matthew Syed:</strong> stated the fact that money does not always equal happiness and that he
            himself finds more sense of accomplishment when after pouring his <mark>heart & soul</mark> into a project
            and getting it finished he receives <mark>feedback</mark> from <mark>people</mark> whom <mark>benefit</mark>
            </m> or<mark>gain</mark> in some way from his work. For him knowimg that what ever he is putting his time and effort into is going to be utilized by many people for the greater good.</li>
        <li><strong>My Perspective:</strong> living successfuly would be about fostering <mark>intellectual growth</mark>, building <mark>sustainable</mark> communities, true success should not just be about individual achievements but about the
            <mark>collective progress</mark> for us as a <mark>species</mark> that respects and nutures the <mark>enviroment</mark> leaving this amazing <mark>planet</mark> of ours for <mark>future generations</mark> to enjoy.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3><u>Also note worthy</u></h3>
    <p><strong>Steven Bartlet</strong> also emphasizes the importance of personal growth, meaningful relationships, and
        creating a positive impact on the world</p>
    <p><strong>Matthew Syed</strong> went on to highlight the value of continuous learning, resilience, and embracing
        failure as a stepping stone to success.</p>

    <h2><u>What is a Growth Mindset?</u></h2>
    <p>A <mark>Growth Mindset</mark> is the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication and hard work.
        It’s about <mark>embracing challenges</mark>, <mark>learning</mark> from <mark>criticism</mark>, and <mark>persisting</mark> in the face of setbacks.</p>
    <h3><u>Tips to Build and Maintain a Growth Mindset:</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>View <mark>challenges</mark> as <mark>opportunities</mark> to grow.</li>
        <li>Replace “I <mark>can</mark>’t” with “I <mark>can</mark>’t yet.”</li>
        <li><mark>Celebrate</mark> small wins and <mark>progress</mark>.</li>
        <li><mark>Learn</mark> from <mark>feedback</mark> and <mark>constructive criticism</mark>.</li>
        <li><mark>Surround yourself</mark> with <mark>people</mark> who <mark>inspire</mark> and <mark>challenge</mark> you.</li>
        <li>Remember that no matter the room or how many people are in it <mark>no one person has all the answers</mark> so <mark>never be
            afraid</mark> to <mark>speak your truth</mark>.</li>
    </ul>
